      I am a marine ecologist working at the intersection of statistical modeling,
      long-term datasets, and ecological theory to understand how marine species respond
      to environmental change over time. My work connects field observations with predictive
      models to inform conservation and the management of coastal and pelagic ecosystems.
      I use species-distribution and environmental data to model and forecast population dynamics.

      I am currently a Master’s student in the Biology Department at Western Washington University,
      advised by Dr. Alejandro Acevedo-Gutiérrez and Dr. Dietmar Schwarz in the Marine Mammal
      Ecology Lab. I study how increased presence of transient killer whales may influence harbor
      seal distribution and Pacific salmon consumption. I’m also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in
      Data Science to deepen my quantitative skills in R and Shiny.

      I earned my Bachelor of Science in Marine Science (Marine Biology concentration) from the
      University of Maine in 2023. I investigated North Pacific humpback whale habitat shifts and
      population dynamics over ~20 years, informed by a semester at the University of Alaska
      Anchorage — Kachemak Bay Campus, where I completed the Semester by the Bay program and an
      Occupational Endorsement Certificate in Marine Mammal Science. In Alaska, I worked closely with
      Dr. Debbie Boege-Tobin and Marc Webber, learning the ins and outs of marine research.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve carried out fieldwork in Maine, Alaska, Florida, and Washington, including behavioral
      observations, acoustic monitoring and analysis, purse seining, marine-mammal rescues, and necropsies.
      Outside of research I love time with my dog, Gully, plus hiking, swimming, being in nature, and a good book.
