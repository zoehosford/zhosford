    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a marine ecologist working on the integration of 
      statistical modeling, long-term datasets, and ecological theory to 
      understand how various marine species may respond to environmental change overtime. My work
      connects field observations with predictive models to inform conservation 
      and management of coastal and pelagic ecosystems. I seek to utilize distribution,
      and environmental data to generate and predict population dynamics in the response to rapidly
      changing environments.

      I am currently a Master's student at Western Washington University in the Biology Department, 
      advised by Dr. Alejandro Acevedo-Gutierrez, and Dr. Dietmar Schwarz in the Marine Mammal Ecology Lab.
      Here, I am working on understanding the impact that increased Transient killer whale presence may have
      on harbor seal distribution and Pacific salmon consumption. I am also working on obtaining a Graduate
      Certificate in Data Science, to work on and better develop my quantitative skills when analyzing data
      using R and Shiny.

      I earned my Bachelors of Science in Marine Science with a Marine Biology concentration from
      the University of Maine in 2023. Here, I took a deep dive into North Pacific Humpback whale habitat
      shifts, and population dynamics, looking at how they have changed over the last ~20 years. This was based on
      observations from when I spent a semester at the University of Alaska-Achorage: Kachemak Bay Campus
      completing the Semester by the Bay program and obtaining an Occupational Endorsement Certificate in 
      Marine Mammal Science. While studying in Alaska, I also had the opportunity to work closely with
      Dr. Debbie Boege-Tobin and Marc Webber, learning about the in's and out's of marine research.

      I have been fortunate enough to complete field research in Maine, Alaska, Florida and Washington in a myriad 
      of different areas, including behavioral observations, acoustic monitoring and analysis, purse seining,
      mammal rescues, and necropsies. 

      When not working on my research, I enjoy spending my time with my dog Gully, hiking, swimming and enjoying nature.
      But also spending time with friends and family, and always enjoy relaxing with a good book.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My research focuses on the intersection of ecology, climate, and data science. 
      I work with time-series, spatial models, and ecological networks to investigate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantifying non-consumptive effects of marine predators</li>
      <li>Predator-prey dynamics among harbor seals, salmon, and killer whales</li>
      <li>Forecasting distribution and consumption patterns</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Methods & Tools</h2>
    <p>
      I rely on quantitative approaches and reproducible workflows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Statistical modeling:</strong> ARIMA, GLS, GAMs, mixed-effects models</li>
      <li><strong>Community analysis:</strong> NMDS, PERMANOVA, Bray-Curtis & Euclidean metrics</li>
      <li><strong>Forecasting:</strong> Holt-Winters, decomposition, time-series prediction</li>
      <li><strong>Software:</strong> R
